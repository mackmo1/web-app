#### **POST /api/leads** - Create Lead
- **File**: `app/api/leads/route.ts`
- ✅ Complete input validation
- ✅ Duplicate email/phone detection
- ✅ Required field validation
- ✅ Default status assignment

#### **PUT /api/leads/[id]** - Update Lead
- **File**: `app/api/leads/[id]/route.ts`
- ✅ Partial updates (all fields optional)
- ✅ Duplicate detection (excluding current lead)
- ✅ Input validation for updated fields

#### **DELETE /api/leads/[id]** - Delete Lead
- **File**: `app/api/leads/[id]/route.ts`
- ✅ Safe deletion with existence check
- ✅ Proper error handling

### 6. **Documentation and Examples**
- **File**: `docs/LEAD_API.md` - Complete API documentation
- **File**: `examples/lead-api-client.ts` - TypeScript client example
- **File**: `tests/lead-api.test.ts` - Test examples and manual testing utilities

## 🎯 Lead-Specific Features

### **Field Validation**
- **Who**: buyer, seller, investor, tenant, landlord

- **Budget**: Supports Indian currency formats (K, L, Cr) and ranges
- **PIN Code**: 6-digit Indian PIN code format

### **Advanced Filtering**
- Filter by lead type (who/intent combinations)
- Property type and status filtering
- Location-based search with partial matching
- Budget range filtering
- Agent assignment filtering
- Date range filtering for lead creation
- Multi-field search across name, email, phone, location

### **Business Logic**
- Automatic duplicate detection by email and phone
- Default status assignment ("new" for new leads)
- Lead priority calculation based on intent and budget
- Lead reference number generation
- Recent lead identification (within 24 hours)
